      <h5>Hi, I'm Becky. I believe that good design is created with empathy to the people, love to the world, rigorous rationale
      and inspiring graphics. I see natural and crafted art in every detail of my life and consider design is always a peprfecting in process.
      I likes to question what has been done and am intrigued to discover what can be done.

      This fall I became a cohort of the Wolverines. Persuing my Master of Science degree in the field of Human Centered Interaction at University of Michigan
      School of Information. I am taking 5 courses in learning Contextual Inquiry and Consulting Foundations, Python, Deisgn of Complex Websites, Introduction to
      Interaction Design, and Fundamentals of Human Behavior.

      Before I step my feet in the realm of UX design, I studied Architecture at University of Washington in Seattle. Influenced by family interest in the construction industry,
      I enjoy studying the history, different ideologies and methodological practice of Architecture, and my education background of Architecture also taught me
      how to take abstract idea to tangible work of design. I hope in the future, I will be able to use my knowledge in HCI to help Architects and other professionals in the industry
      with better working experience of the many tools they use.

      Aside from my academic and working experience, I spend my spare time in reading a wide range of literature from Plato, Rousseau to Tagore, George Orwell. I found philosophy
      and politics fascinating. I appreciate art pieces by Jackson Pollock, Monet, Raphael and etc. My favorites movies are directed by Quentin Tarantino, Wong Kar-Wai, and David Lynch.

      I was born in Shaoyang China, grown up in Shanghai China, and began my journal in the U.S. since 2009. Some favorite places I have travelled to are
      Florence, Capri, Cancun, and Carmel.

      Thank you for stopping by.</h5>
